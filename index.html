	Hi, I'm Jhemerson and this is my own diary. I want to use this space to share my thoughts, my views of the world, my dreams, my life style and my stories. I know everyone has a story and that you're probably tired of so many people trying to share with you these same things I am proposing and I understand that. For this reason I understand you might not be interested but hey, maybe there is something cool I can share with you and I might be able to bring you some entertainment, after all, we're all looking for something -- and this something we're looking for is called "cure for boredom". Join me and let's have some fun!
